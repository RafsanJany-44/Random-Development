group_delete proposal algorithm:

1. fetcth every topic_id from disscussion_topic and delete that topic_id from discussion_topic_bp_action
2. delete from disscussion_topic where org_id= and dc_id=
3.delete from discussion_category where org_id= and dc_id=
4.delete from discussion_category_members where org_id= and dc_id= 




#todo later

 message delete algorithm: 2 types...one is for me another is for every one. 

select * from public.discussion_topic where topic_details='waseem alarm'

select * from public.discussion_topic_bp_action where topic_id=82775

delete from public.discussion_topic_bp_action where topic_id=82775

delete from public.discussion_topic where topic_id=82775


there is two type of delete functionality. one is the for own(remove for you) another is for all(remove for all).... tow option will apear for
 for sender own msg. and only one option( remove for you) will apear for other msg
